## Welcome to QCL N2opocules

This is a tools for assessing N2O isotopocule fluxes and quality assurance from QCL data. Its developped by the Sustainable Agroecosystem (SAE) group at ETH Zurich.

Functions available:
- N2O Flux Chamber Master script (prepare QCL rawdata, offset correction and dilution calibration, flux calculation)
- Minimal required flux for reliable delta estimates

## Installation

its only a R script, that has not been turned into a function yet!
